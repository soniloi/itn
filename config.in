# This config file is split into three sections:
#	1. Input specification: stuff that should be configured according to how the files being parsed are formatted
#	2. Semantic specification: preferences about the cutoff levels etc. to use when putting together various statistics
#	3. Output specification: stuff about how output should be formatted
# Anything from '#' to the end of a line is ignored, unless it is within double-quotes
# Denote single characters between single-quotes e.g. 'a'
# Denote strings between double-quotes e.g. "orange"
# Denote numerals without any start or end markers, decimal format only
# No escape characters in strings
# If a key is found more than once, the last instance seen will be taken as its value
